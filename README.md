- Name: `Hanshi Tang`
- Student ID: `1266337`

## Student Instructions
You **must** write up `README.md` for this repository to be eligable for readability marks.

4. Students must store all curated / transformed data in the `data/curated` folder. We will be running your code from the `scripts` directory to regenerate these.
6. Finally, your report. If you are using overleaf, you can download the `.zip` and extract it into this folder.
8. Add your relevant `requirements.txt` to the root directory. 


## README example

**Research Goal:** My research goal is analyse demand and 

**Timeline:** The timeline for the research area is 2023-12-01 to 2024-05-31

To run the pipeline, please visit the `scripts` directory and run the files in order:
1. `downloading_1.py`: This downloads the tlc raw data into the `data/landing` directory.
2. `downloading_2.py`: This downloads the weather raw data into the `data/landing` directory.
3. `downloading_3.py`: This downloads the event raw data into the `data/landing` directory.
4. `1.1 preprocessing_1.ipynb`: This notebook details preprocessing steps for tlc data and outputs it to the `data/raw`.
6. `1.2 preprocessing_2.ipynb`: This notebook details preprocessing steps for weather data and outputs it to the `data/raw`.
7. `1.3 preprocessing_3.ipynb`: This notebook details preprocessing steps for event data and outputs it to the `data/raw`.
9. `1.4 preprocessing_4.ipynb`: This notebook details preprocessing steps for event data and outputs it to the `data/curated`.
10. `1.4 preprocessing_4.ipynb`: This notebook details preprocessing steps for event data and outputs it to the `data/curated`.
11. `EDA_1.ipynb`: This notebook is used to conduct analysis on the curated data.
12. `EDA_1.ipynb`: This notebook is used to conduct analysis on the curated data.
13. `model_analysis.ipynb`: The script is used to run the model from CLI and the notebook is used for analysing and discussing the model.
